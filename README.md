> To-Do App

## Description

A simple To-Do application. Where you can add, edit and delete tasks. 
You can also mark them as done, or undo that action. 
On the bottom you can filter the tasks by status and see the counter for them as well.   

## Few notes:

The server to this application is running on heroku. 

The authentication is not yet done, so you can log in with any credentials. It
is just the UI layer for now.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
