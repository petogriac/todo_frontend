## Few notes:

The server to this application is running on heroku. 

The authentication is not yet done, so you can log in with any credentials. It
is just the UI layer for now.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
